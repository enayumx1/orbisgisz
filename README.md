H2GIS
=====

H2GIS is a spatial extension of the H2 database engine in the spirit of [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/). It adds support for managing spatial features and operations including a `Geometry` type, [Open Geospatial Consortium](http://www.opengeospatial.org/) (OGC) functions as well as functions that we (the [Atelier SIG](http://www.irstv.fr/)) develop. 

H2GIS is the main project for the new OrbisGIS data management library and is divided into 3 subprojects:
* H2Geometry
* H2Spatial
* H2SpatialDriver

H2GIS
=====

H2GIS is the main project for the new OrbisGIS data management library. 

It's based on the H2 database and proposes to extend it to manage of spatial features and operations. 
Our goal is to include spatial capabilities: a geometry type, spatial OGC functions (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs) and thematic functions developed by the Atelier SIG team (http://www.irstv.fr/). 

We plan to offer a spatial extension to H2 in the spirit of POSTGIS.

H2GIS projet is divided in 2 sub-projects.

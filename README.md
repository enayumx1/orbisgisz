H2GIS
=====

H2GIS is the main project for the new OrbisGIS data management library. 

It's based on a H2 database and proposes to extend it to manage of spatial features and operations. 
Our goal is to include spatial capabilities: a geometry type, spatial OGC functions 
and thematic functions developed by the Atelier SIG team (http://www.irstv.fr/). 

We plan to offer a spatial extension to H2 in the spirit of POSTGIS.

H2GIS projet is divided in 3 sub-projects.

H2Geometry


H2Spatial


H2SpatialDriver
